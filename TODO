KanjiPad enhancements
---------------------

* GNOME-ize KanjiPad
* Add command line options to point to the data file
* Work some more on thinning and see if we can make it work
  OK. (Though not really needed for speed)
* Options dialog - 
   Thinning 
   Data file location
* Write a browser for sample files
* Automatic test program running engine against sample files
* Make strokes thicker - calligraphic ? Integrate with gsumi??? ;-)
* Allow entering multiple characters and storing them for pasting
  as a bunch into another application

Enhancments in cooperation with JavaDict and JStroke
